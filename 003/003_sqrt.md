# SQRT Time????
- Basically, a way to jump over the array when there are two conditions that should be met
- Two crystal balls problem explain how it should be done

## How does it work
- Walk the array jumping its len of sqrt, if the contion is met, walk backwards for the second one
- walk forward linearly until the condition breaks
