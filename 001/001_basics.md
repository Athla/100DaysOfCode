## Big O Time Complexity
### What is BIG O?
- It categorizes the algo in time or memory requirements, helping to understand how it performs in worst case scenario
- Help to make decision about which Data Structure to use
- **As the input grows, how much does the computation/time grows?**
- Constants are not taken in account when thinking in *BigO*
- Growth is with respect to the input
- Worst case most of the time will be considered
#### Normal notations
- O(1) - Linear time, input does not matter
- O(log n) - Slowly grows with the input
- O(n) - Grows with the input
- O(nlog n) - Grows with boost alongisde the input
- O(n^2) - EXPLODES!
- O(sqrt(n)) - wtf!?

## Arrays
- Arrays are the most basic type of Data Structures
- Why TypeScript?
    - Simple and beginner friendly
