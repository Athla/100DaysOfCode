# Queues - A Implementation of a Linked List (Singly!)
- FIFO - first in, first  out
- brish call it line
- nodes points to nodes
- its also a singly linked list
- It's a constraint of a base data structure, by doing that, you achieve a better time complexity output
- For that to happen, it must be contained inside its constraints
- Taking this in account, it's a contant time operation:
    O(1)
- **Constraints make things faster inside it's bounds.**
